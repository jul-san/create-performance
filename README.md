### Create Performance Task

First ever coding project that I've done. This was for my AP Computer Science Principles class back in December of 2021 and was programmed through Code.org so no HTML/CSS is available. It's not much, but this is what first sparked my interest in programming so I decided to leave it here. 

Scored a 5 on the AP Exam overall.
